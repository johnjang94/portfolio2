          I&#39;m a Product Designer at a start-up called The Sahki, where I am
          currently on a mission to modernize traditional attire. I focus on
          creating stylish designs that align with business objectives and
          enhance customer satisfaction.

          I take a strategic approach to my designs. I assess the business
          structure and examine its value in the market. I also consider the
          context that the business offers its value and the voice of the users.
          I am deeply interested in understanding the message and always enjoy
          the journey of finding the match between the valuable visuals and the
          voices I heard. I learnt all that including the process UX at York
          University and have been attending different UX workshops from various
          organizations such as DesignX community to keep up with my practical
          UX skill sharp even today.

          you might catch me at gym (working out hard), at bookstores (reading
          for new inspirations) or{" "}
