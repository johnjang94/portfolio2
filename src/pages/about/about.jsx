          I&#39;m a Product Designer at a start-up called OPERATION EASE, where
          I am currently on a mission to automate hospitality management with a
          group of talented designers. I focus on MVP that align with business
          objectives and increase user satisfaction.

          Coming with a background in Neuroscience, Education, and Software
          Development, UX/UI Design or Product Design was indeed not my first
          destination either as my occupation or as a career. On the other hand,
          I was always intrigued by how different types of visuals interact with
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was interested in understanding how visuals (i.e. typography, color,
          different shapes of elements, etc.) influence the way we interpret and
          decide on things ever since high school, and I have come to notice
          that I was actually interested in getting my feet wet into the field
          of UX Design or as a Product Designer while I was working as an ESL
          instructor in Korea. In fact, the nature of the job that I had in
          Korea required me to keep the students engaged while keeping up their
          report cards with good grades (if not excellent or outstanding). I
          needed to think hard on how the lessons can be interactive and
          entertaining while attaining good enough visuals, textures, and tools
          that trigger their senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          After wrapping up my experience in Korea, I started to seriously think
          through and tried to identify this journey of understanding the
          connection between the visuals and human-responses. After a while, I
          was able to recognize that this type of interaction is called UX/UI
          Design (or so called as Product Design).
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Product Designer, I try to be strategic that I consider user
          voices, technical aspect of the development, and business aspect. I am
          deeply interested in understanding the message that we receive from
          the stakeholders and the users, and enjoy the process of iteration on
          finding the match between the valuable visuals and the voices I hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides designing, I have a number of hobbies and that I lost count.
          To name a few, I enjoy running, dancing, singing, climbing, traveling,
          etc. These days, you might catch me at gym (working out hard), at
          bookstores (reading for new inspirations) or{" "}
