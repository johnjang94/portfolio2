        <p>Our primary focus was on the following three points:</p>
        <ul className="px-10 list-disc space-y-5">
          <li>Distinguish Menus</li>
          <p className="px-5">
            In the initial sketch, we placed the desktop menu bigger and
            highlighted at the bottom of the screen to indicate that it is for
            the desktop. For the mobile, we indicated more menus inside the
            mobile screen instead.

          <li>Utilize the space</li>
          <p className="px-5">
            In the original screen, there are too much white gaps that are left
            unused. We have decided to use up the space as much as we can.

          <li>Interaction</li>
          <p className="px-5">
            We created new design to make sure that the users are getting
            notified whether they are joining a video session, recording the
            session or leaving the video-call.
