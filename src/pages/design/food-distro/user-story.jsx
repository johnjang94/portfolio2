          In terms of specific tasks, we came up with a statement on what they
          need to do in order to donate the food to each other. The following
          action statement is an example:
        </p>
        <p>
          &#34;As a donation-receiver, I want the ability to search for surplus
          food in the neighbourhood using a map so that I can decide the option
          that best suits me based on the location.&#34;

            user would be able to see a precise location of the food-giver
          </li>
          <li>
            user would be able to see a specific list of food items that are
            offered by the food-giver.
          </li>
