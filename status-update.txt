< Progress report >
- On Sunday, June 2, 2024, I have spent about 10 hours to figure out how to connect Front-End and Back-End using Vercel and AWS.
- On Monday, June 3, 2024, I have made a further progress by connecting both sides on the localhost. Now, the puzzle is how to actually deliver the service on the internet.
